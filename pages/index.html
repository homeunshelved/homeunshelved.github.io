        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Anxiety, Nostalgia, and Halloween</h2>

            <h3 style="text-align:center;">A Halloween Collection</h3>
                <p>This candy container tells the story of home: The home where a young child sat, exhausted after a long night of trick-or-treating, as they devoured the sweet, colorful candy that once filled this container. An ancient, Celtic home filled with the rich scent of pine and heavy with anticipation of Samhain festivals. A new home in an unfamiliar place that Irish refugees built with the traditions, games, and beliefs they held dear. The home where anxious parents waited as their children embarked on neighborhood adventures. And the home of the collector, where the candy container sits, a prized possession.<a href="#fn9" id="ref9"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding:0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto3.jpg"></a></p>

                <p>My grandfather, a collector of many things, gifted this candy container to me when I was a teenager. The candy container, made in the 1950s, has been with me ever since, along with my growing collection of Halloween items. While I’ve moved several times, the candy container is always there, it is a necessary part of my home.</p>

                <p>A sweet, musty odor emanates from the small candy container - residue from candy held long ago and the smell of aged, stored plastic. Holding the container requires cautious hands, as one can almost feel the brittle plastic giving way. When I set it on the table it clinks of cheap, thin plastic. The container is showing its age, as there are some scratches, scuff marks, and fading of the paint, signs of moving and unprotected display. On the lower back side of the container, you can feel etched plastic that reads: “ROSBRO PLASTICS PROV. R.I.”<a href="#fn10" id="ref10"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto4.jpeg"></a></p>

        <h3>Folklore and Tradition</h3>
                <p>The Jack-o-lantern, looking amused on the back of the <a href="http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198607663.001.0001/acref-9780198607663-e-150" target="_blank">cat</a>, is the spirit of a man, too evil to enter Heaven and rejected by the Devil. Doomed to walk the earth forever, Jack placed a hot coal in a gourd and now wanders alone, banished from Heaven and Hell. In Celtic tradition, organic objects - fruits and vegetables - represented both the harvest and concepts of the spirit world. Gourds, like the one Jack used, were central to the ancient Celtic celebration of Samhain, a New Year celebration and marker of the harvest. Stories of Samhain traditions reveal that during Samhain, supernatural entrances to other worlds opened. As the supernatural and human realms collided men battled demons and made love to supernatural women. Samhain was unpredictable, dangerous and exciting, revealing the anxieties of peoples whose home lands were threatened by Christian expansion.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

        <a href="#fn11" id="ref11"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto6.jpg"></a>

             <p>As Christians appropriated these Celtic traditions and established All Souls Day in the Middle Ages, Samhain-like festivals spread throughout Europe, and eventually to the United States. However, modern Halloween celebrations only began to take shape in the United States in the late 19th century when Irish refugees fled to the United States in large numbers. Met with racism, these refugees created new homes and communities out of ancient traditions.</p>

            <h3>Halloween in America</h3>
                <p>While the candy container reminds us of sweet candy corn and chocolate, twentieth-century Halloween celebrations were more trick than treat. Children overturned outhouses and threw rotten vegetables at homes and residents alike. Young “gangsters” threatened elderly neighbors on their doorsteps with “trick-or-treat.”<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> But as “trick-or-treating” grew in popularity, a night of mischief became tame. By 1940, both Irish Americans and Halloween solidified their place in an emerging, white middle class.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Throughout the United States, upper class women hosted Halloween parties featuring dinner, dancing, and a wide range of games.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p>

        <a href="#fn12" id="ref12"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto5.jpg"></a>

               <p>The engraving on the bottom of the candy container, “ROSBRO PLASTICS PROV. R.I.” reveals the beginning of a now nearly ubiquitous relationship between Halloween and candy, marked by mass production and consumption. In the early twentieth-century, folks appeased trick-or-treaters with homemade caramelized popcorn balls and sweet candied apples. However, as cities grew and suburbs expanded, so too did the number of trick-or-treaters. In the 1950s, small plastic and packaged candy containers like this became a more convenient and less expensive option to dish out to the hoards of young tricksters at their door.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></p>

                <p>However, this candy container isn’t only the product of affordability and convenience. Consumed with fear of the “Halloween sadist” with his poisoned candy and razor blade apples, worried parents turned to prepackaged treats throughout the 1960s and 1980s. Newspapers warned of the terrors of trick-or-treating, and some communities went so far to ban trick-or-treating. The Jack-O-Lantern smiles at us, because he knows that these myths and rumors were the greatest Halloween trick of all.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto2.png"></a> A sign of the anxiety of a nation in crisis, these stories make good sense. On the nightly news, stories of poisoned popcorn balls and bubble gum played out alongside images of violent civil rights demonstrations, riots, and the Vietnam war.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Parents became cautious and skeptical of a cherished tradition. They hurried their children home to safety, eager to inspect their children’s loot.</p>

            <a href="#fn14" id="ref14"><img style="clear:left;width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto1.png"></a><br>

        <h3>A Halloween Collection, Revisited</h3>
                <p>Nostalgic for the days of carefree trick-or-treating, people began to collect vintage Halloween memorabilia in the 1980s. My grandmother started collecting Halloween items after finding a glass Halloween candy container in an antique shop that was in her home as a child. Together, my grandparents became avid collectors. Comparing trick-or-treating today to the 1940s, Derek’s grandfather remarked that it was “not that much different, but no one thought about the danger of Halloween.”<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></p>
<a href="#fn15" id="ref15"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto7.jpg"></a>

                <p>Collecting allows us to peel back the layers of Halloween. There exists a dark history behind this smiling jack-o-lantern. Fear is a central part of Halloween. Children march from house to house begging at neighbors’ doors, while parents wait anxiously for their return home. Yet Halloween is sweet and exciting. The candy container speaks of happy memories of trick-or-treating, of family. What does collecting truly represent? Could it be nostalgia, or, instead, an outlet for our deepest fears?</p>

          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Histories and Home</h1><h2 style="text-align:center;">In a Leather Notebook</h2>

            <h3>What is “home”?</h3>
                <p>What is “home?” “Home” is embedded in this notebook.“Home” is the taste of fresh caught crabs and Old Bay. Home is the sounds and smells of the Celtic Festival, the Jousting Tournament, the Renaissance Festival.<a href="#fn10" id="ref10"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/ren-faire.jpg"></a></p>

                <p>I bought this miniature embossed leather notebook at the Maryland Renaissance Festival around 2010. It settles nicely in my hand. It feels natural. Earthy. The rigid, embossed front unfolds to reveal unfinished leather and rough, unlined paper. At the time, I thought I might have something to add behind the facade one day. The notebook was in my possession for about a year before I left home during my senior year of high school because a parent tried to prevent me from continuing my education. This was the only item I took from the house. Sometimes I wonder, why <i>this</i> thing?</p>

            <h3>The "Renaissance"</h3>
                <p>Most surviving miniature books of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (now called the "Early Modern" period in most academic circles) were individualized Catholic prayer books popular in the 13th and 14th centuries.<a href="#fn11" id="ref11"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/jeanne-hours.jpg"></a> This was the time of the Black Death, the Hundred Years War and the Avignon papacy. The prayer books were signs of the privatization of faith, of the increasing reliance on personal devotion as old institutions were torn asunder. The aspects of “home” which had once seemed so stable: the Church, social order, personal well-being, were all unsettled. These books were born of fear and anxiety in a world steeped in blood, plague, death.</p> 

                <p>This, though, is a modern souvenir which “displaces the point of authenticity as it itself becomes the point of origin for narrative.”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Modern miniature books sold at Renaissance festivals are not exclusively created or sold for religious purposes as these modern festivals developed during the 1960s.<a href="#fn12" id="ref12"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/islamic1.png"></a> They are not “authentic” replicas of Books of Hours. This notebook, for example, contains Islamic influences seen in the folded cover and the natural and geometric patterns on the leather.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> The inclusion of this stylistic element was not common in Renaissance miniature prayer books, but is more so in Renaissance festival crafts.</p> 

                <p>The Islamic influences in the design speak to a history of exploitation during the Reconquista and the Crusades.<a href="#fn13" id="ref13"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/islamic2.png"></a> As Crusaders returned from Jerusalem and Spain, they brought back new artistic inspirations. But they also carried home a religiously fueled hysteria which resulted in the unsettling and massacring of Jews, Muslims, and perceived heretics throughout Europe. The gentle floral field on the leather notebook’s cover hides the massacre of the Jews of Worms in 1096, the frenzied butchering of the Muslims and Jews of Jerusalem in 1099, the blood of Cathars flowing through the hyacinth and poppies of Béziers in the summer of 1209, flowing like the stinking blood of cattle at the slaughter…</p>

                <p>Made of the skin of a cow, this notebook speaks to us through smell as well as sight. Leather, real leather, has a distinctive smell, an ancient smell. In medieval Europe, the tanning process was a dirty job. First, the cattle had to be killed, usually by a butcher. A tanner then scraped the hides clean of their blood, soaked them in urine, re-scraped the hides, soaked them again in bird droppings or stale beer, left them in a solution of oak bark and water for over a year, and then a currier worked the now tanned hides into usable leather.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Modern artisans no longer produce leather this way, instead tended to buy industrially produced, chemically treated leather.<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding:0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/IMG_3029.JPG"></p> 

                <p>Even so, Renaissance festival craftsmanship prides itself on authenticity. Artisans’ “labor was the labor of the hand, of the body, and the product, in its uniqueness, was a stay against Repetition and inauthenticity.”<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> The emphasis on personal craftsmanship and the Renaissance continues to resonate with modern Americans. The image of the individual artisan living on his own labor flows easily into the American archetype of the lone cowboy, living on the “open range.” As historian Paul Grendler argues, “Americans really love the American West… like the Renaissance, it is viewed as an age of individual achievement.”<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></p>

            <h3>The "Old West"</h3>
                <p>In the popular conception of the “American West,” leather was used less for books and more for saddles and gun holsters.<a href="#fn14" id="ref14"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/guns.gif"></a> When we think of the “Old West” we can almost hear the thundering hooves of cattle, the creaking leather of a saddle, the screeching of an incoming train.</p>

                <p>But whose home was “the West”? In the 1840s, Brigham Young said, “We will raise our wheat… and produce everything that will make our bodies comfortable and happy and in this manner we intend to build up Zion on the earth.”<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> Mormon settlers hoped to make the West “home.” But there was an addendum to Young’s speech. He added “...and purify it and cleanse it from all pollutions.”<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> In the Mormon settling of "the West," who was unsettled? The history of the Mormon move westward is a story of displacement, often violent, of native people. Their cattle grazed on lands relied upon by native people. They massacred new settlers and blamed Native Americans for the slaughter.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> Creating home is a dirty job.</p>

                <p>The sounds of Westward expansion were the of a groaning wagon wheel, a rail spike being driven into the ground. These were the sounds of home being taken, and home being built. But when I think of “the West,” I don’t hear hear the melodies of Mormon music. Maybe I should. Today, as the sound of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir drifts through households across the United States, we are reminded that Mormons still seek to establish America as home. Historian Benjamin Lindquist argues that the Mormon Tabernacle Choir functions to convince Americans that “not only possessed quintessentially American characteristics, but they had colonized the Great Basin and, consequently, earned the right to remain there.”<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> Sound stakes a claim to “home”.<a href="#fn15" id="ref15"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/cowboys.jpg"></a></p> 

                <p>These stories of “the West” don’t make it into the popular imagination. They don’t have all the fictive romance of a cattle drive or the rugged cowboy. But in the popular imagination, it is bold individualism that speak to us from both the Renaissance and the Old West. It speaks to us through creaking leather. So, why did I take <em>this</em> thing? The notebook embodies histories: of individualism, of self-definition, but also of dispossession and control.</p>

            <h3>What is “home," Part 2</h3>
                <p>Can "home" unsettle? When "you can't go home again," what is home? “Home” is leaving one Spring afternoon, feeling the sun on your face, the weight lift off your shoulders, and of not looking back. “Home” is a small, still empty, leather notebook sitting in a dark closet for 6 years. And “home” is forcing yourself to look back by keeping an uncomfortable reminder of your past on your bedside table. It is realizing that a notebook is more than a tangible thing. It embodies your past, and your drive towards the future. “Home” is looking at a leather notebook and still smelling the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
