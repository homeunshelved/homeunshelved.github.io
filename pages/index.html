                        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Catch Me if You Can!</h1>
                            <h4 style="text-align:center;">by Derrick Kay and Steve Lechner</h4>
<p>Home is creation, the place you made. It is first steps, and memories that cannot fade. For the gingerbread boy, it was a cottage on the forest’s edge: a place where magic flourished.</p> 
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>"There was once a little old man and a little old woman, who … would have been a very happy old couple but for one thing--they had no little child, and they wished for one very much. One day, when the little old woman was baking … she cut a cake in the shape of a little boy, and put it into the oven."</strong></p>
<p>Home is the woman who nurtured you. It is her sacrifice and care. Home is her hopes and fears. It is the pain of leaving her there. The old woman made the gingerbread boy to be her special one, but soon he was on the run.</p>
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>"Presently she went to the oven to see if it was baked. As soon as the oven door was opened, the little gingerbread boy jumped out, and began to run away as fast as he could go."</strong></p>
<p>Home stalks. It chases. Home will not go away. Home might haunt you till your last day. The entire village chased the gingerbread boy. No peace could he enjoy.</p> 
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>"But the pig ran, and couldn't catch him. And he ran till he came across a fox, and to him he called out: I've run away from a little old woman, a little old man, a barn full of threshers, a field full of mowers, a cow and a pig, and I can run away from you, I can!"</strong></p>
<p>Home is a threat. It might eat you whole. The wage it demands is your very soul. In the end, the gingerbread boy could not outrun the fox, who ate him without remorse.</p> 
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>"Now foxes can run very fast, and so the fox soon caught the gingerbread boy and began to eat him up. Presently the gingerbread boy said, "Oh dear! I'm quarter gone!" And then, "Oh, I'm half gone!" And soon, "I'm three-quarters gone!" And at last, "I'm all gone!" and never spoke again."</strong></p>
<p>More than all that, home is a journey that moves ever forward to the bright and the new. Home is to run without fear, without care, without doubt.  Home is not a place, it's you, only you. The gingerbread boy still runs to this day. I know it’s so for we run together you might say.</p>
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>"Run! Run! As fast as you can! You can’t catch me, I’m the Gingerbread Man!"</strong></p>
<p>For me, home is a complicated concept. Movement has always been part of my story.  In this regard, the gingerbread boy is a role model, or perhaps an alter ego.  We see the journey as all.  A girl I once knew gave me this toy over thirty years ago. She intended to honor my recent flight from a rotund mall security guard during which I cried, "Run! Run! As fast as you can! You can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man!" The little girl’s grandfather had purchased the toy for her in the early 1970s. The gift sealed a relationship, if just for the moment. It then became movement; the journey full speed. Boston, Missouri, LA, Tulsa, Des Moines, and Maine were borrowed homes along the way. At every stop, the gingerbread was there--physically present, and metaphorically influential.</p>

<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/GB_1.jpg">
<p>The Scamp Gingerbread Boy is a plush, stuffed toy manufactured by Douglas Company of Keene, New Hampshire. He measures thirteen inches from heel to crown, with a wingspan close to ten inches. His pose suggests motion – he is running right now. He has a rusty-brown hue, with round, black eyes that match his round, back nose. His only clothes, if you can call them that, consist of two round, white buttons attached to midriff and chest, a red and white scarf, a matching red and white chapeau (the kind you might see in a Parisian café). The toy shows the blemishes of age, including noticeable wear on the left palm. Nevertheless, the boy flashes a constant smile; at least that is what we see. Despite his connection to confection, he does not emit a scent nor does he elicit a tasting experience. His silence invites us to learn his secrets. </p> 
 
<h3>The Roots of a Spice and a Story</h3>
<p>Ginger cultivation represents historical trends of globalization and trade. Although initially cultivated in India and China in prehistoric times, the proliferation in the production of ginger came about through its introduction to the Caribbean via New World colonization. Production of the spice grew exponentially in Spanish territories throughout the sixteenth and early seventeenth century, until sugar production supplanted the commercial viability of ginger cultivation. The crop did not immediately find a market in Spain. Instead, it took a firmer economic root in northern Europe where ginger offered a wet and hot tropical taste in colder, drier climates.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> The first English uses of ginger appeared within elite cookbooks and recipes of the sixteenth century. Some credit Elizabeth I for ordering the creation of the first gingerbread men. Throughout the seventeenth century, ginger became a common component of English cooking. At the same time, English songwriters lauded ginger for its ability to provide energy and vitality to the unmotivated.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p> 
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>A Poor Soul sate sighing near a Ginger-bread Stall, 
Oh Ginger-bread, oh! Oh Ginger-bread, oh! 
With his Hands in his Pockets, his Head on the Wall; 
Oh Ginger-bread, oh! Oh Ginger-bread, oh!<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></strong></p>

<p>Unlike the story of our Scamp Gingerbread Boy, the gingerbread man narrative is not strictly an American tale, nor solely indicative of a larger American literary genre. The story’s basic tenets are part of the Runaway or Fleeing Pancake folktale genre.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> In the mid-nineteenth century, two Norwegians, Peter Asbjornsen and Jorgen Moe, collected folk traditions from Western Scandinavia as part of a nationalist project to define Norwegian culture. This effort emerged from Norway’s independence from four centuries of Danish rule. Asbjornsen and Moe wanted to use folklore and heritage (including cooking and storytelling) to shape a common understanding of Norwegian culture. The Fleeing Pancake was one folk story that emerged from this endeavor.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> Norway, however, does not hold a monopoly on the fleeing food genre. Other folktales, emanating from Germany, Scotland, Russia and the United States, all intermix tales of a bolting baked good eluding its pursuers before being eaten by a hungry entity. The fleeing pancake is a cumulative tale--offering little plot, relying instead on rhythm and repetition.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> In the case of the gingerbread chase, the rhymes are used to taunt pursuers while each new encounter builds suspense, leading to the climax: the baked good being consumed by its final chaser.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> </p>

<h3>Alterations in the Journey</h3>   
<p>The Gingerbread Boy of the American imagination first appeared in print in 1875 in the St. Nicholas Magazine for Boys and Girls. The anonymous author indicated that the story was "not strictly original. He had written it down after a servant girl relayed it to his children."<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> In a mischievous and less taunting fashion, upon opening the oven door, the gingerbread boy jumped out and ran away.</p> <img style="width:100%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/1875.png">
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;"><strong>"I’ve run a-way from a lit-tle old wom-an, a lit-tle old man, And I can run a-way from you, I can!"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup></strong></p>
<p>In later versions, the gingerbread boy became an anti-authority legend. He mocked and taunted his pursuers with the now iconic line:</p> 
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>"Run! Run! As fast as you can! You can’t catch me, I’m the Gingerbread Man!<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup></strong></p>
<p>The gingerbread story was further expanded and altered at the turn of the twentieth century. Frank Baum incorporated it into his Oz mythology and Frederic Ranken and Alfred Baldwin Sloane adapted it into a musical. Both enterprises use the name of John Dough for the gingerbread creation but retain little, beyond the materiality of the central figure, of the original gingerbread story. Nonetheless, Ranken’s 1905 opening and Baum’s 1906 publication helped popularize the central fairy tale figure of the gingerbread man. Ranken’s musical centers on the story of flavorful King of BonBonLand who is living in fear of being eaten after being turned into a gingerbread man by his nemesis, Marchevavelius. The intrepid Mr. and Mrs. Clause eventually resolve the conflict by turning the King back into a human being.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> </p>

<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;" alt="PDF embed is not supported in this browser."><strong>My life's a gingersnap, They've hung me in a window, marked
A penny each a throw, And the girls on the street
Say I'm just fit to eat, The original John Dough.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></strong></p>

<p>In Baum’s iteration, John Dough is the accidental creation of a baker trying to create a large gingerbread man to celebrate July Fourth. After mixing in an Arabian Elixir of Life, the dough comes alive and eventually embarks on a journey with Chick the Cherub, a central figure in this gingerbread incarnation.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> Ali Dubh, who had planned to use the elixir to grant himself health and longevity, pursued John Dough. John Dough now embodied these qualities. After eluding Ali Dubh, John Dough became the ruler of Hiland and Loland, a realm of people who were awaiting the coming of a non-human replacement king.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> Each interpretation adds elements to the gingerbread story while retaining the tale’s central components: fear of consumption and aspects of the chase/journey.</p>
<img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/BaumGB.jpg">
<h3>The Journey Toward Home</h3>
<p>The gingerbread boy narrative, and its many iterations, embodies multiple anxieties – desire, intimacy, confinement, freedom, and consumption.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> These anxieties, all rooted in home, fuel the journey. Like the boy, they made me the adventurous kind. Now, consider your own path, with these last words in your mind.</p> <br>
<h4 style="text-decoration:underline;text-align:center;">Long Live the Gingerbread Boy</h4>

<pre style="text-align:center;">A tale embedded in old Viking snow,
A fleeing pancake obscure, but the cookie you know.

The good woman dreamed of one she could hold,
In the oven he went to be caste from a mold.

But the boy’s plans transcended the plain wooded home,
He yearned for adventure, no choice but to roam.

He ran from those who wished him harm,
His ceaseless movement caused the woman alarm.

Wherever the journey, his wry smile stayed clear,
Keep moving, keep moving without worry or fear.

In the end he was eaten, devoured in whole,
Yet pay close attention, sense the gingerbread’s soul.

There is a lesson to learn from the cookie boy’s tale,
Life lived at full speed is never a fail.</pre>

                <h3>A Halloween Collection</h3>
                <p>This candy container tells the story of home: The home where a young child sat, exhausted after a long night of trick-or-treating, as they devoured the sweet, colorful candy that once filled this container. An ancient, Celtic home filled with the rich scent of pine and heavy with anticipation of Samhain festivals. A new home in an unfamiliar place that Irish refugees built with the traditions, games, and beliefs they held dear. The home where anxious parents waited as their children embarked on neighborhood adventures. And the home of the collector, where the candy container sits, a prized possession.<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding:0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto3.jpg"></p>

                <p>My grandfather, a collector of many things, gifted this candy container to me when I was a teenager. The candy container, made in the 1950s, has been with me ever since, along with my growing collection of Halloween items. While I’ve moved several times, the candy container is always there; it is a necessary part of my home.</p>

                <p>A sweet, musty odor emanates from the small candy container&mdash;residue from candy held long ago and the smell of aged, stored plastic. Holding the container requires cautious hands, as one can almost feel the brittle plastic giving way. When I set it on the table it clinks of cheap, thin plastic. The container is showing its age, as there are some scratches, scuff marks, and fading of the paint, signs of moving and unprotected display. On the lower back side of the container, you can feel etched plastic that reads: "ROSBRO PLASTICS PROV. R.I."</p>

        <h3>Folklore and Tradition</h3>
                <p>The Jack-o-lantern, looking amused on the back of the <a href="http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198607663.001.0001/acref-9780198607663-e-150" target="_blank">cat</a>, is the spirit of a man, too evil to enter Heaven and rejected by the Devil. <img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/candyPhoto4.jpg">Doomed to walk the earth forever, Jack placed a hot coal in a gourd and now wanders alone, banished from Heaven and Hell. In Celtic tradition, organic objects&mdash;fruits and vegetables&mdash;represented both the harvest and concepts of the spirit world. Gourds, like the one Jack used, were central to the ancient Celtic celebration of Samhain, a New Year celebration and marker of the harvest. Stories of age-old traditions reveal that during Samhain, supernatural entrances to other worlds opened. As the supernatural and human realms collided men battled demons and made love to supernatural women. This time of year was unpredictable, dangerous and exciting, revealing the anxieties of peoples whose home lands were threatened by Christian expansion.<sup><a href="#fn1a" id="ref1a">1</a></sup><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto6.jpg"></p>

   
             <p>As Christians appropriated these Celtic traditions and established All Souls Day in the Middle Ages, Samhain-like festivals spread throughout Europe, and eventually to the United States. However, modern Halloween celebrations only began to take shape in the United States in the late nineteenth century when Irish refugees fled to the United States in large numbers. Met with racism, these refugees created new homes and communities out of ancient traditions.</p>

            <h3>Halloween in America</h3>
                <p>While the candy container reminds us of sweet candy corn and chocolate, twentieth-century Halloween celebrations were more trick than treat. Children overturned outhouses and threw rotten vegetables at homes and residents alike. Young "gangsters" threatened elderly neighbors on their doorsteps with "trick-or-treat."<sup><a href="#fn2a" id="ref2a">2</a></sup> But as "trick-or-treating" grew in popularity, a night of mischief became tame. By 1940, both Irish Americans and Halloween solidified their place in an emerging, white middle class.<sup><a href="#fn3a" id="ref3a">3</a></sup> Throughout the United States, upper class women hosted Halloween parties featuring dinner, dancing, and a wide range of games.<sup><a href="#fn4a" id="ref4a">4</a></sup></p>

        <img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto5.jpg">

               <p>The engraving on the bottom of the candy container, "ROSBRO PLASTICS PROV. R.I." reveals the beginning of a now nearly ubiquitous relationship between Halloween and candy, marked by mass production and consumption. In the early twentieth-century, folks appeased trick-or-treaters with homemade caramelized popcorn balls and sweet candied apples. However, as cities grew and suburbs expanded, so too did the number of trick-or-treaters. In the 1950s, small plastic and packaged candy containers like this became a more convenient and less expensive option to dish out to the hoards of young tricksters at their door.<sup><a href="#fn5a" id="ref5a">5</a></sup></p>

                <p>However, this candy container isn’t only the product of affordability and convenience.<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto2.png"> Consumed with fear of the "Halloween sadist" with his poisoned candy and razor blade apples, worried parents turned to prepackaged treats throughout the 1960s and 1980s. Newspapers warned of the terrors of trick-or-treating, and some communities went so far to ban trick-or-treating. The Jack-O-Lantern smiles at us, because he knows that these myths and rumors were the greatest Halloween trick of all.<sup><a href="#fn6a" id="ref6a">6</a></sup> A sign of the anxiety of a nation in crisis, these stories make good sense. On the nightly news, stories of poisoned popcorn balls and bubble gum played out alongside images of violent civil rights demonstrations, riots, and the Vietnam war.<sup><a href="#fn7a" id="ref7a">7</a></sup> In racially homogenous suburbs, white parents became cautious and skeptical of a cherished tradition. They hurried their children home to safety, eager to inspect their children’s loot.</p>

        <h3>A Halloween Collection, Revisited</h3>
                <p>Nostalgic for the days of carefree trick-or-treating, people began to collect vintage Halloween memorabilia in the 1980s.<img style="clear:left;width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto1.png"> My grandmother started collecting Halloween items after finding a glass Halloween candy container in an antique shop that was in her home as a child. Together, my grandparents became avid collectors. Comparing trick-or-treating today to the 1940s, my grandfather remarked that it was "not that much different, but no one thought about the danger of Halloween."<sup><a href="#fn8a" id="ref8a">8</a></sup></p>
<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto7.jpg">

                <p>Collecting allows us to peel back the layers of Halloween. There exists a dark history behind this smiling jack-o-lantern. Fear is a central part of Halloween. Children march from house to house begging at neighbors’ doors, while parents wait anxiously for their return home. Yet Halloween is sweet and exciting. The candy container speaks of happy memories of trick-or-treating, of family. What does collecting truly represent? Could it be nostalgia, or, instead, an outlet for our deepest fears?</p>

              <h1 style="text-align:center;">Hearts & Spades</h1>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">by Claire A. Kempa</h4>

<h3>Home(sickness)</h3>
<p>Home is other people. This phrase is as familiar as a cross-stitch or a commercial; a lapse of vigilance and it slides past scrutiny with ease. Like all good aphorisms, however, it implies a sharp-edged truth: if home is other people then homesickness arises from their loss. <p>
 
<h3>A Perfect Gift</h3>
<p>The box caught my eye first. It stood out among the jumble of grey watches and beige porcelain figures on the estate sale table: blood-bright, love-red, it would be a fine mount for the vintage valentine I had been saving for him. But the cards inside made it a perfect Valentine’s Day gift: a rarity to delight his collector’s mind, an homage to the homonymous connection between playing and greeting cards, and a commemoration of his storied years as a teenaged cardshark.<p>
<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/VC_card.JPG">
Imagine you are holding it, as I am now. The sleeve is stiff cardboard, red and shiny from the  plastic coating. A loop of tape holds the early twentieth-century valentine to its front. I stuck it there, sacrificing resale value to inscribe the box with new meaning: a Valentine’s Day gift. Palm the box over--it is awkward in my hand, but fits his perfectly--and you will find an earlier inscription: "Remembrance Advertising at Work for Keith B. Young 518 South Highland, Chanute, Kansas." The original owner, it seems: a World War II veteran who, at some point, likely placed two mismatched decks of cards within the double-sided bridge box which bears his name.<p>

<p>The right-hand deck matches the branded box. It was produced by Minnesota's Brown & Bigelow Remembrance Agency between 1945 and 1950. The cards on the left slot are interlopers: a 1943 plane-spotting deck produced by the United States Playing Card Company on behalf of the Coca-Cola Company for distribution to soldiers. Their original box was flimsy cardboard, yellow to match the color that frames the painted woman on their backs. Even short a joker and an ace, these are a collector’s trifecta of market desirability: playing cards, Coca Cola advertising, and World War II memorabilia. <p>
<img style="float:left;padding:12%" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/VC_cardhand.JPG">
<p> Fan a poker hand’s worth of cards from each deck, one in each hand, and hold them to your face in turn. Breathing into them reveals their pasts. The Remembrance deck seems little-used; the cards smell like the box: old but clean, cardboardy. The edges support this supposition: some retain the off-white color of the original cardstock; tilt them and they shine slightly where the gold foil of the box has rubbed into them. Flex your fingers around them: though over seventy years old, they are still factory-stiff. Not so the planespotting cards. Even the full deck has a supple bend to it, as only much-shuffled cards do. Their edges are darker, dirtier, and the faces are browned and smudged. Hold the King of Spades at a slant under a bright light and you can discern what may be a dirty fingerprint. This deck is fragrant in contrast to the other. As a historian, I will tell you that they smell simply musty, perhaps <em>handled</em> or perhaps just aged. As a romantic, I will say: they smell like fingersweat and pockets, with an undertone of aftershave. <p>

<h3>Love & Death</h3>
<img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/VC_stval1.jpg">
<p><p>I didn’t know, when I bought them, that these cards have plausible ancestors in Korea, India, or China.<sup><a href="#fn1b" id="ref1b">1</a></sup> I thought, like many nineteenth-century historians, that playing cards were "the devil’s picture books," descended from tarot; in truth, like chess, they originate from Asia. While their direct lineage is unclear, they came to Europe in the fourteenth century, arriving through the port cities of Italy alongside trading goods and bubonic plague. <sup><a href="#fn2b" id="ref2b">2</a></sup> Perhaps the German monk who, in 1377, penned the first surviving European record of playing cards prayed to St. Valentine--one of the 22 saints assigned patronage of bubonic plague--for his survival. <sup><a href="#fn3b" id="ref3b">3</a></sup><p>
<img style="width:35%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/VC_stval2.jpg">
<p>Valentine was, even then, associated with love.  In 496 Pope Gelasius I designated February 14 the feast day for not one, but three martyred Valentines, separate individuals merged by time and myth.<sup><a href="#fn4b" id="ref4b">4</a></sup> Their deaths were occluded by the Roman fertility festival of Lupercalia which held that date before their births.
<p> St. Valentine is a composite of folklore and religious canon: throughout the centuries, his life has been gradually rewritten to match the sexual connotation of Lupercalia. Stories have him passing love notes to his jailer’s beautiful daughter: the first valentines.  In the nineteenth-century, British Victorians fully severed the figure of St. Valentine from religion and bound him to commodification, exemplified by the secular ritual of exchanging greeting cards.<sup><a href="#fn5b" id="ref5b">5</a></sup><p>
	      
<p>The real men called Valentine have been--at least--triply lost. But the mythicization of these two men is hardly the only casualty of the lasting allure of Lupercalia, which determines that February 14 is associated with love. Neither saints nor humans intervened on behalf of the 900 Jewish residents of Strasbourg, in modern-day France, who were burnt to death on February 14, 1349 by their Christian neighbors.<sup><a href="#fn6b" id="ref6b">6</a></sup><p> I didn’t know about them, when I fixed my paper valentine to the red cardbox and brought both into our home. It is easier to believe that home is built on love than death.<p>

<h3>The Girl Back Home</h3>
          <p> <img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/VC_coke.jpg"><p>These cards were commodities even before I made them into a valentine. Coca-Cola products are perennially collectible, but the mid-century advertisements are particularly desired for the painted women that they often display. The men who painted Coca-Cola ads in the 1940s drew inspiration from, and even produced, pin-ups. Open-mouthed and loose-limbed, peacetime advertisements are women’s bodies commodified, selling sex as much as soda.<sup><a href="#fn7b" id="ref7b">7</a></sup></p> 

          <p>The advertisement on the playing cards is different from its peacetime counterparts: painted and printed in 1943, this is a woman of war, uniformed and straight-backed with a serious expression and a closed mouth. <p> <img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/VC_woman1.jpg">But despite its seeming chastity, this image captures the cultural anxiety that surrounded the 6 million women who left the private sphere of the home and went to work on the home front.<sup><a href="#fn8b" id="ref8b">8</a></sup><p>  Propaganda celebrated some working women as patriots, even as the press condemned others as either overly-masculine or hyper-sexual. The line between "patriot" and "prostitute" was so blurred that government authorities coined a middle category: "patriotute."<sup><a href="#fn9b" id="ref9b">9</a></sup><p>  Despite her solemn patriotism, the woman on the cards is a patriotute:  the cards themselves are a commodity, and the woman printed on them is an operator, connoting availability with an undertone of sex. After all, "call-girl" had been slang for "prostitute" since 1930. And on the cards she is always available: the 54 miniature representations of her face all promise intimacy to the soldier. She can be cradled invisibly within cupped hands; one of her can be taken anywhere: perhaps the fate of the deck’s missing Ace of Diamonds.</p>
<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/VC_clean.jpg">

          <p>The living women condemned as patriotutes occupied an impossible position. The government campaigned stridently against venereal disease, spreading propaganda among soldiers which warned not only of prostitutes, but of "the noncommercial girl who is supplanting the prostitute as the main source of venereal disease."<sup><a href="#fn10b" id="ref10b">10</a></sup><p>  At the same time, both government-paid entertainers and unsanctioned "pin-up girls" were expected to embody home, reminding soldiers what they fought for.<sup><a href="#fn11b" id="ref11b">11</a></sup>  Coca-Cola’s four guidelines for World War II advertising were "Speed, Clean Wholesome People, Ideas, and Fine Painting."<sup><a href="#fn12b" id="ref12b">12</a></sup> The planespotting cards were wholesome enough to pass under the U.S. Navy's ban on pin-up images. Some men, whether or not they were allowed to keep printed material, made their own pin-ups:  paintings on the noses of planes and bombs, dangerous women turned into weapons and pointed towards the enemy. Though government and corporations worked to separate patriots from prostitutes--and love from death--images women proliferated through war, uncontrollable as disease.</p>
 <img style="float:left;padding:12%" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/VC_noseart.jpg">
<h3>War Games</h3>
          <p>If the back of the cards are inscribed with sex, their faces are a textbook of war. Cards have been used as unconventional texts for centuries, teaching everything from heraldry to history. They have been used to teach the visual language of warfare since the Swiss published deck of military uniforms in 1744; the plane-spotting cards of World War II built in this tradition, pairing countries with suits.<sup><a href="#fn13b" id="ref13b">13</a></sup></p>
          <p> <img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/VC_takecare.jpg"> The instructions originally packaged with these cards advised soldiers to supplement their more conventional games with quizzes about the silhouettes. Better to prepare them to recognize, upon the first whine of engines, the source of an aircraft: England, Germany, Italy, Japan?</p>

          <p>Did they take their lessons through hearts, spades, poker, solitaire--those men circled together in the belly of their ship? It doesn’t matter. Cards are two-sided no matter the game: home front and front line, populated by allies and enemies clearly sorted by suite. The stories that these figures tell can have the simplicity of a myth, a fairy tale, a romance: the girl back home, the homesick sailor, fighting the Good War. The sharp edge of cardstock between them is no thicker than a fingernail; scant space to write the stories of the invaded, the refugees, the bystanders, the victims. The enemies with human faces and homes of their own. </p> <img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/VC_spades.jpg"><p>These last are more easily discerned in the histories of recent military card decks. In Vietnam, the American military dealt augurs of death  from specially-manufactured decks consisting solely of the Ace of Spaces.<sup><a href="#fn14b" id="ref14b">14</a></sup> The members of the National Liberation Front who viewed this card as an ill omen were forced to play this game of psychological warfare. Spades, weaponized. The American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan were issued decks printed with the faces and known details of the Pentagon’s 55 most wanted targets: tactical directives, miniature bounties.<sup><a href="#fn15b" id="ref15b">15</a></sup> They were presented to the television-viewing public in the hands of Army Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks in 20003, immediately sparking a market of reproductions as some Americans clamored for the chance to bring the heads of their enemies into their homes.<sup><a href="#fn16b" id="ref16b">16</a></sup></p>
<img style="width:50%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/VC_iraqcards2.JPG">

          <p>And still new decks are made, for good reason: cards are uniquely effective texts for training the minds of soldiers. In wartime, distance and violence take their tithe from memory. Trauma can shrink the size of the hippocampus by as much as 8%, and with it the capacity of short-term memory; it may damage the prefrontal cortices, diminishing both working memory and the ability to acquire and retain aural and verbal information.<sup><a href="#fn17b" id="ref17b">17</a></sup><p> Though America lacked this medical knowledge in the 1940s, planespotting cards suggest an instinctive understanding of this toll. Haptic memory and visual learning remain relatively intact throughout trauma. The cards, and the tactile experience of handling them, are mnemonic. They teach the most fundamental lesson of warfare: how to distinguish enemy from ally.  But the lessons learned in war games are not soon forgotten, and the soldiers who survive to return home carry them in their bones.</p>
 
<h3>(home)Sickness</h3>
          <p>My own home has sickened. In the first weeks of his absence--sudden, circumstantial, unsought--homesickness rooted. It germinated in the jar full of stubbed movie tickets and meal receipts; on the pressed pennies that line the windowsill, embossed with the names of roadside attractions; beneath the box lids of our board games; in the gifts that I’ve given him, each one unmoved from wherever he placed it. I live among these tableaus with the hush and caution of a museum visitor. I breathe in the dust that films their surfaces, and I am infected.</p>

          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Home Unbound</h1>
                <h4 style="text-align:center;">by Jason Norris and Katie Schinabeck</h4>
            <h3>What is "home"?</h3>
                <p>"Home" is embedded in this notebook. "Home" is the taste of fresh caught crabs and Old Bay. Home is the sounds and smells of the Celtic Festival, the Jousting Tournament, and the Renaissance Festival.<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/ren-faire.jpg"></p>

                <p>I bought this miniature embossed leather notebook at the Maryland Renaissance Festival around 2010. It settles nicely in my hand. It feels natural. Earthy. The rigid, embossed front unfolds to reveal unfinished leather and rough, unlined paper. At the time, I thought I might have something to add behind the facade one day. The notebook was in my possession for about a year before I left home during my senior year of high school because a parent tried to prevent me from continuing my education. This was the only item I took from the house. Sometimes I wonder, why <i>this</i> thing?</p>

            <h3>The "Renaissance"</h3>
                <p>Most surviving miniature books of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (now called the "Early Modern" period in most academic circles) were individualized Catholic prayer books popular in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.<img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/jeanne-hours.jpg"> This was the time of the Black Death, the Hundred Years War and the Avignon papacy. The prayer books were signs of the privatization of faith, of the increasing reliance on personal devotion as old institutions were torn asunder. The aspects of "home" which had once seemed so stable: the Church, social order, personal well-being, were all unsettled. These books were born of fear and anxiety in a world steeped in blood, plague, and death.</p> 

                <p>This, though, is a modern souvenir which "displaces the point of authenticity as it itself becomes the point of origin for narrative."<sup><a href="#fn1c" id="ref1c">1</a></sup> Modern miniature books sold at Renaissance festivals are not exclusively created or sold for religious purposes as these modern festivals developed during the 1960s.<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/islamic1.png"> They are not "authentic" replicas of Books of Hours. This notebook, for example, contains Islamic influences seen in the folded cover and the natural and geometric patterns on the leather.<sup><a href="#fn2c" id="ref2c">2</a></sup> The inclusion of this stylistic element was not common in Renaissance miniature prayer books, but is more so in Renaissance festival crafts.</p> 

                <p>The Islamic influences in the design speak to a history of exploitation during the Reconquista and the Crusades.<img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/islamic2.png"> As Crusaders returned from Jerusalem and Spain, they brought back new artistic inspirations. But they also carried home a religiously fueled hysteria which resulted in the unsettling and massacring of Jews, Muslims, and perceived heretics throughout Europe. The gentle floral field on the leather notebook’s cover hides the massacre of the Jews of Worms in 1096, the frenzied butchering of the Muslims and Jews of Jerusalem in 1099, the blood of Cathars flowing through the hyacinth and poppies of Béziers in the summer of 1209, flowing like the stinking blood of cattle at the slaughter…</p>

                <p>Made of the skin of a cow, this notebook speaks to us through smell as well as sight. Leather, real leather, has a distinctive smell, an ancient smell. In medieval Europe, the tanning process was a dirty job. First, the cattle had to be killed, usually by a butcher. A tanner then scraped the hides clean of their blood, soaked them in urine, re-scraped the hides, soaked them again in bird droppings or stale beer, left them in a solution of oak bark and water for over a year, and then a currier worked the now tanned hides into usable leather.<sup><a href="#fn3c" id="ref3c">3</a></sup> Modern artisans no longer produce leather this way, instead tending to buy industrially produced, chemically treated leather.<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding:0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/IMG_3029.JPG"></p> 

                <p>Even so, Renaissance festival craftsmanship prides itself on authenticity. Artisans’ "labor was the labor of the hand, of the body, and the product, in its uniqueness, was a stay against Repetition and inauthenticity."<sup><a href="#fn4c" id="ref4c">4</a></sup> The emphasis on personal craftsmanship and the Renaissance continues to resonate with modern Americans. The image of the individual artisan living on his own labor flows easily into the American archetype of the lone cowboy, living on the "open range." As historian Paul Grendler argues, "Americans really love the American West… like the Renaissance, it is viewed as an age of individual achievement."<sup><a href="#fn5c" id="ref5c">5</a></sup></p>

            <h3>The "Old West"</h3>
                <p>In the popular conception of the "American West," leather was used less for books and more for saddles and gun holsters.<img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/guns.gif"> When we think of the "Old West" we can almost hear the thundering hooves of cattle, the creaking leather of a saddle, the screeching of an incoming train.</p>

          <p>But whose home was "the West"? Mormon settlers were among those who hoped to make the West "home." In the 1840s, Brigham Young, leader of the Mormon move westward, expressed these hopes: "We will raise our wheat… and produce everything that will make our bodies comfortable and happy and in this manner we intend to build up Zion on the earth."<sup><a href="#fn6c" id="ref6c">6</a></sup> Mormon settlers were among those who hoped to make the West "home." But there was an addendum to Young’s speech that exemplified what was required for "the West" to be settled. He added "...and purify it and cleanse it from all pollutions."<sup><a href="#fn7c" id="ref7c">7</a></sup> In order for the Mormons to make the "West" their home, who was unsettled? The history of the Mormon move westward is a story of displacement, often violent, of Native peoples. Their cattle grazed on lands relied upon by Native peoples. They massacred new settlers and blamed Native Americans for the slaughter.<sup><a href="#fn8c" id="ref8c">8</a></sup> Mormons were not unique in their <a href="http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/railroads.html" target="_blank">move Westward</a>, nor in their treatment of Native peoples, but their search for a "Zion on the earth" is notable among the other waves of settlers. Creating home is a dirty job.</p>

                <p>The sounds of Westward expansion were the sounds of groaning wagon wheels and rail spikes being driven into the ground. These were the sounds of home being taken, and home being built. But when I think of "the West," I don’t hear hear the melodies of Mormon music. Maybe I should. Today, as the sound of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir drifts through households across the United States, we are reminded that Mormons still seek to establish America as home. Historian Benjamin Lindquist argues that the Mormon Tabernacle Choir functions to convince Americans that Mormons "not only possessed quintessentially American characteristics, but they had colonized the Great Basin and, consequently, earned the right to remain there."<sup><a href="#fn9c" id="ref9c">9</a></sup> Sound stakes a claim to "home".<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/cowboys.jpg"></p> 

                <p>These stories of "the West" don’t make it into the popular imagination. They don’t have all the fictive romance of a cattle drive or the rugged cowboy. But in the popular imagination, it is bold individualism that captures imaginations and seems to reflect both the Renaissance and the Old West. So, why did I take <em>this</em> thing? The notebook embodies histories, including my own: of individualism, of self-definition, but also of dispossession and control.</p>

            <h3>What is "home," Part 2</h3>
                <p>Can "home" unsettle? When "you can't go home again," what is home? "Home" is leaving one Spring afternoon, feeling the sun on your face, the weight lift off your shoulders, and of not looking back. "Home" is a small, still empty, leather notebook sitting in a dark closet for 6 years. And "home" is forcing yourself to look back by keeping an uncomfortable reminder of your past on your bedside table. It is realizing that a notebook is more than a tangible thing. It embodies your past, and your drive towards the future. "Home" is looking at a leather notebook and still smelling the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align:center;"><i>Receptek</i>: Of Repasts and Remembrances</h1>
		<h4 style="text-align:center;">by Sylvia Bailey and Dr. Judy Kert&#233;sz</h4>

<h3>Taste</h3>


          <p>Food is essential to all life. Before we study food and contextualize its consumption across regions and time, assess its global or local connections, or use it to highlight the means by which it shapes historical processes or the social construction of memory, we sow it. We grow it. We plant, reap, kill, butcher, and process it. We ritualize food, transforming it into meals by preparing, serving, blessing, eating, feasting, devouring and hungering for it. We condemn it as fast and revere it as art. Sometimes we even remember to taste it. We serve food as much as it serves us.  Food is at once resource and remembrance. It is us.</p>

          <p>Many families inherit a designated notebook in which someone created, communicated, and recorded recipes of meals remembered. <img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/002RJ_2.jpg"> Margit Muresian Kert&#233;sz Halmos's <i>Receptek</i>, with its yellowed pages, is testimony to a rich cooking tradition that mixes Hungarian, German, and Ashkenazi Jewish ingredients with memories.<sup><a href="#fn1d" id="ref1d">1</a></sup> The middling-sized 9" x 6 &#188;" notebook is not sturdy or substantial enough to stand on its own on a bookshelf. Its thin, brittle pages, parched and dry to the touch, drier still when turned, shelter recipes collected over the course of five generations. The <i>Receptek</i> is a survivor. It resisted the whims of food stains, the dust of war, and anguished dislocations across numerous borders, one ocean, and two continents. Someone repeatedly taped the notebook's disintegrating edges, binding the damaged and discolored cover to its worn back and the fragile pages nestled within. The tape's smoothness speaks to the deceptions and temptations of preservation, the anxiety of losing what remains. <img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/003RJ_3.jpg"> Short paragraphs in Hungarian torment readers hampered by a knowledge system that favors grams and ounces over "handfuls," "smidgens," and "pinches"; they tease the translator, warning them of the transience of knowledge, the instability of recall.  Margit's handwriting, with its adherence to lines and spaces, the controlled loops with their artistic precision in blue ink, stress the pace of twentieth-century change. Her exacting hand also reminds us that people encrypt the strength and weaknesses of their personalities with the stroke of a pen.</p>

<p>Not all books smell the same. To bury one's nose in the <i>Receptek</i> is to inhale the aroma of ground wood with notes of vanilla and almonds, the tang of acid over an underlying decomposition. Engagement with the notebook's recipes enhances more than our relationship to the past. We can sense the past while admonishing ourselves of the inevitability, the fragility of time.</p>

<h3><i>&#201;des</i> (Sweet)</h3>

          <p>Compiled in the aftermath of World War II from an earlier iteration of a recipe journal, Margit's <i>Receptek</i> tells many stories. As a child, Margit watched her <i>Anyuk&#225;m</i> ("mother dear") knead, pound, churn, mix, simmer, stir, boil, stew, roast, and bake ingredients into meals. The abrupt end to her childhood came with the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the dangers of famine, forced flight and homelessness. The initial sweetness of life, drawn from mother's milk gave way to a steady diet of acrid tasting peppers and cucumbers, leafy vegetables of kale and cabbage, and the acidity of tomatoes. <img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/004_RJ1.jpg"> Margit's mother, and her mother before her, enhanced the fatty, earthy flavors of beef, pork, and melted butter with the pungency of onions, mustard, and radishes. They encouraged their children to soak up every drop of their meal with the hearty wheat-flour cultured with yeast, which when manipulated into dough and baked, became <i>Keny&#233;r</i> ("bread"), the staple of their diet. Margit measured belonging and made "home" with the ingredients that went into her <i>S&#252;tem&#233;nyeket</i> (pastries), such as <i>T&#250;r&#243;s torta</i> ("cheesecake"), <i>Di&#243;kr&#233;m torta</i> ("walnut cream cake"), and <i>Rig&#243; Jancsi</i>, a traditional Hungarian chocolate cream pastry. <i>Gesztenyep&#252;r&#233;</i> ("chestnut pur&#233;e") and all manner of jams, strudels, pies, and confectionery reflect a long history of ethnic and cultural mixing.</p>

          <p><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/005_RJ.jpg">Like many a wanderer, sugar also has its own stories of cross-cultural clash and coexistence, as well as danger, dispossession and flight. First domesticated in New Guinea roughly 10,000 years ago, the cultivation of sugar spread to Southeast Asia, the sub-continent, and East Asia. By the mid-fifteenth century, Portugal began to produce large quantities of sugar in the Canary and Cape Verde Islands and its New World colony of Brazil by expropriating the labor of enslaved Africans. Sugar so excited the palates of early modern European drinkers of tea and coffee – plant foods also appropriated through colonization – that its consumption fueled the rise of Atlantic World empires and slavery.<sup><a href="#fn2d" id="ref2d">2</a></sup> By the twentieth century, with the dependence of local economies on a globalized marketplace, the world had developed an enormous sweet tooth. </p>

          <p><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/01RJ.jpg"> The sweetness that is essential to the confections that Margit loved to make compliments and mocks the chaos and impermanence of her childhood. Born in 1903 in the polyglot city of Temesv&#225;r, Hungary (present-day Timi&#537;oara, Romania), Margit was the daughter of a German Catholic mother and Romanian Eastern Orthodox father.  Margit's parents and their three children fled north to Debrecen with the outbreak of World War I. The precipitous growth at the beginning of the twentieth century that had encouraged Margit's parents to settle in Temesv&#225;r now ignited ethnic tensions.<img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/02RJ.jpg"> Wartime food shortages soured then spoiled the tenuous peace of prosperity that the Austro-Hungarian Empire had established in the previous century. Hungarian and German Catholics reviled the mysticism of Romanian Orthodoxy, nativist Romanians pled for national cohesion and a return to Eastern Orthodoxy, Hungarian and German Protestants looked down upon Catholics and Orthodox believers alike. Their shared past was unable to withstand a divisive present. One of the few things that they all could agree upon was their hatred of the Jews.<sup><a href="#fn3d" id="ref3d">3</a></sup> </p>

          <p>The family relocated once again to Breslau, Schlesien (formerly Prussia, now Wroc&#322;aw, Poland). <img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/03RJ.jpg"> For five years, Margit did not taste the sugared goods that she loved. Instead, the family subsisted on flour mixed with water. The slightly sweet caramelized flavor of a potato when roasted over an open fire was a welcome distraction from belly cramps.  Alarms and wails assaulted ears. Soot from explosions and fires remained in the atmosphere, begriming houses and palates, settling onto clothes and hidden stores of tubers, fluttering into eyes and damming nostrils and sources of fresh water. There was little to savor, few safe harbors to provide succor for the exile in a war-torn world with no possibility or desire to return. Unlike Lot's wife, Margit never looked back, making a portion of her cooking journal a meditation on how and why people root themselves to one another rather than to one place.</p>

<h3>S&#243; &#233;s F&#369;szer (Salt and Spice)</h3>

          <p>The end of the Great Compromise of 1867 that created the Austro-Hungarian Empire began with the assassination of the Hapsburg Archduke, Franz Ferdinand in 1914 and culminated with the fall of four empires -- Austro-Hungarian, Russian, German and Ottoman -- and the end World War I. It took a little more than one year for Margit's mother and siblings to make their way to Budapest. <img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/04RJ.jpg"> By then, Margit's father had abandoned the family. Would Hungary's capital prove any more nurturing than the other cities where the family had hoped to sojourn? The greater availability of food suggested so, from meat, tubers, root vegetables, and the salt that preserved them, to herbs, flour, dairy products, and most importantly, the indispensable spice of the Hungarian diet: the rich, aromatic, sweet, ground red pepper flavor of <i>paprik&#225;s</i>.</p>

          <p>Hungarians use <i>paprik&#225;s</i> in a wide variety of dishes. It is the must-have ingredient that distinguishes Hungarians as a people. <img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/05RJ.jpg"> While it provides Hungarians with a sense of belonging and permanence, <i>paprik&#225;s</i> is ground from the red, air-dried pepper that is indigenous to present-day central Mexico. The history of <i>paprik&#225;s</i>, similar to sugar, is one of dislocation and dispossession. After their conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Spanish introduced plant varieties of pepper to the Mediterranean where they became part of the circuit of trade in exotic flora from the Americas. Within half a century, the Ottoman Turks were producing an early version of the spice in Budapest, the capital of a sixteenth-century kingdom wracked with internal dissension and peasant uprisings.</p>

          <p>Past, present, and future, east and west, conqueror and conquered, all coalesce in a dish of <i>Sz&#233;kely guly&#225;s</i> (Transylvanian goulash), <i>Paprik&#225;s csirke</i> ("chicken paprika"), <i>P&#246;rk&#246;lt</i> ("stew"), and <i>Lecs&#243;</i> (a hearty vegetable ragout). <img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/06RJ.jpg"> For <i>magyarok</i> ("Hungarians"), <i>paprik&#225;s</i>, and only Hungarian <i>paprik&#225;s</i>, is able to bring together the rich variety of peppers and onions, tomatoes and potatoes, root vegetables and meats that define Hungarian cuisine. Margit's family recipes provided a sense of security and belonging that enabled the family to link itself to the ambitions of "magyarization," the assimilationist, nation-building agenda that encouraged those who found themselves within Hungary's post-World War I borders – regardless of their ethnicity--to become <i>magyarok</i>. </p>

          <p>Hungary first extended the ability to assimilate, and thus, become Hungarian, to Jews in 1867. The Great Compromise of that year that enables us to understand Margit's complex childhood is also central to understanding the processes that enabled Margit to marry her husband. <img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/07RJ.jpg">One of the bills that came out of the Great Compromise granted full civil rights to Jews. It passed with little opposition. As a result, the Jewish population of Hungary grew rapidly, much of it due to immigration from neighboring regions. Ten years into the interwar period, the woman with the German-Romanian ancestry, whose sheer existence embodied the complexities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, added yet another layer to her identity when she married Mikl&#243;s Kert&#233;sz, and converted to Judaism. </p>

          <img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/10RJ.jpg"><p>Mikl&#243;s's family exemplify the historical processes of Jewish assimilation in Hungary during the late nineteenth century.<sup><a href="#fn4d" id="ref4d">4</a></sup> They changed their surname from Klein to Kert&#233;sz, proudly adopted Hungarian ideals and interests, and sang Hungarian folk songs with fervor. Loyal nationalists, they nevertheless called themselves <i>Zsid&#243;vall&#225;su magyarok</i> ("Hungarians of the Jewish faith").<sup><a href="#fn5d" id="ref5d">5</a></sup> It was in Budapest that Mikl&#243;s and Margit met, married, moved to a fashionable address, lived as secular Jews, and raised two children.<sup><a href="#fn6d" id="ref6d">6</a></sup> It was in Budapest that the couple immersed themselves in the rich cultural life of the metropolis.<sup><a href="#fn7d" id="ref7d">7</a></sup></p> 

<p><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/11RJ.jpg"> The passage of the first wave of anti-Semitic laws in 1928 reveal a growing national resistance to the assimilationist politics of the previous century.In the wake of such laws, the couple clung more firmly to their circle of friends--well-educated, professional, middle-class Jews--and to Mikl&#243;s's large family in Sz&#233;ch&#233;ny. From 1927 until 1944, during <i>Yamim Noraim</i> (&#1501;&#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1501;&#1497;&#1502;, "the high holy days"), and for <i>Pesach</i> ("Passover"), multiple generations of the Muresian, Klein, and Kert&#233;sz family gathered, and over prayers, rituals, and meals, they remembered.</p>

          <p>Memory is central to Judaism. The modern word for history in Hebrew derives from the Greek &#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#945; ("Historia"). Far more important to Judaism, however, is &#1503;&#1493;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1494; ("Zikaron" or "memory"). Zikaron is a common Hebrew liturgical and literary term. It first appears when God remembers Noah and the other living creatures in the ark, and when God remembers his covenant after the great flood.<sup><a href="#fn8d" id="ref8d">8</a></sup> Jews refer to <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> as the "Day of Remembrance," whereby both God and humanity are commanded to remember.<sup><a href="#fn9d" id="ref9d">9</a></sup> A central element of the holiday is the incorporation of food, which constructs the collective identity of a people and their history. It is insufficient merely to recount incidents from the past; Jews must relive and re-embody histories of belonging through the rituals of memory that determine the religious calendar.</p>

<h3>Keser&#369; (Bitter)</h3>

          <p>By 1944, Mikl&#243;s had died and Margit was a widow living with her two children in Budapest. On the eve of Allied victory over Nazi Germany, Hungary, a German ally, sought to negotiate a peace independent of Germany. Despite the series of anti-Jewish measures, the majority of Hungary's 725,000 Jews lived in relative safety during World War II.<sup><a href="#fn10d" id="ref10d">10</a></sup> Indeed, by 1944, Hungarian Jewry was the largest surviving Jewish population that remained in all of Europe. <img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/15RJ.jpg">Germany occupied Hungary on March 19, 1944. German and Hungarian cynicism could not have been more conspicuous. The Third Reich's assault on Hungary coincided with the Jewish observance of <i>Purim</i> (March 9-10) which marks the deliverance of the Jews from the Persian Empire. On April 7, 1944, one day before <i>Passover</i>, the celebration of the Exodus from Egypt, Hungarian officials agreed to the wholesale roundup of Hungary's Jews. It was the last time that the family came together to remember.</p>

          <p>Words cannot contain, nor can they faithfully relate the destruction of an entire family. The brutal disruption at dawn on June 8, 1944. The loud, insistent pounding on front doors. Sneering gendarmes barking orders. "Quick!" "Pack!"  "Hurry!" "You have half an hour!" Homes slammed shut. The confused march to the schoolyard. For more than five hours, Sz&#233;ch&#233;ny's Jewish population, a little more than three hundred souls, stood in the pouring rain before the military police scuttled them down the town's deserted streets toward the railway station.<sup><a href="#fn11d" id="ref11d">11</a></sup></p>  

          <p>For thirty years, until she passed, Margit never spoke about what happened that day. Not once. Not because she was there. She was not. She was in Budapest. However, her two children were. June. A time of leisure and sun, laughter and light. Margit's children always spent their summer vacations in Sz&#233;ch&#233;ny, some fifty miles north of Budapest, with their grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins.<sup><a href="#fn12d" id="ref12d">12</a></sup>  Surreptitiously smuggled into the care of sympathetic Christian neighbors, Margit's children made their harrowing return to Budapest under cover of night. Germans of the Third Reich killed roughly 7 million Soviet civilians and 3 million Soviet prisoners of war, 2 million Poles, 300,000 Serbs, 250,000 disabled persons, 220,000 Roma (Gypsies), 70,000 homosexuals, political dissidents and prisoners, 2,000 Jehovah's Witnesses, and more than 6 million Jews.<sup><a href="#fn13d" id="ref13d">13</a></sup> Almost one-half of all Jews murdered at Auschwitz-Birkenau were Hungarian Jews whom the Germans gassed within a period of ten weeks. Those who managed to survive endured the devastation of irreparable loss, the ties that create "home."</p>

          <p>How did they persevere?</p>

          <p>Celebrants of the traditional <i>Seder</i>, the ritual service and ceremonial dinner of Passover actively engage with memory through the materiality of food.  They drink wine, partake of symbolic foods, feast to their freedom, and give thanks. Margit's <i>Receptek</i> features most of the ingredients that go into preparing just such a seder, but only a few of the holiday's appropriate dishes: Margit's careful notation of how best to smoke herring and whitefish, the proper amount of horseradish and endives for a salad whose bitterness should not overwhelm, yet still remind. The commandment to eat the <i>maror</i> ("that which is bitter") is to remember the pungent, acrid taste of exile, the deprivations of freedom, the threat of annihilation.</p>
		  
<h3><i>Savany&#250;</i> (Sour)</h3>
          <p><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/13RJ.jpg">If there was one place left in Hungary where Jews could hide, it was Budapest. For more than one year, Margit and her children sought shelter in their apartment building's cellar. Bombs and fires were a constant source of anxiety. Yet, the cavernous space of the cellar was able to accommodate the entire building inhabitants for weeks on end and withstand the blasts that shattered the streets above. <img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/17RJ.jpg"> Food, once again, was a scarce commodity and for interminably long stretches of time, Margit and her children subsisted on the monotony of flour, water, and dried beans. Stored, long-forgotten pickled cabbage and cucumbers provided a welcome change.
		  
		  <p>Even after the defeat of Germany, the inhabitants of Budapest, Jew and Gentile alike, continued to hide, this time from Russian soldiers who came in the guise of liberators. <img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/18RJ.jpg">Besieged Budapest quickly learned otherwise. For a little more than one decade, Margit and her children attempted to negotiate limitations to their freedom enforced by the country’s Soviet occupiers. Hungary’s lure proved perishable, having turned, then spoiled like so much sour milk. In the aftermath of the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, Margit once again turned her back, packed her memories, and sought refuge elsewhere. The <i>Receptek</i> accompanied her on yet another exile, promising both sustenance and sanctuary.</p>

          <p>Margit's <i>Receptek</i> ultimately, is an offering of thanks to the marvel of food in all of its tastes and permutations. It also highlights the tensions between the tangibility of compiling, preserving, and handing down recipes with the intangibles of memory encoded in them. It is a witness. More than a spectator, Margit's recipes revel in the ironies of difference and the incongruities of cultural, sociopolitical, and religious change. In doing so, her <i>Receptek</i> encompasses the many contradictions that one person can bring together to create "home."</p>
