                        <h1 style="text-align:center;">The Journey Toward Home</h1>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">What is “home”?</h3>
<p>Home is creation, the place you made. It is first steps, and memories that cannot fade. For the gingerbread boy, it was a cottage on the forest’s edge: a place where magic flourished.</p> 
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>“There was once a little old man and a little old woman, who … would have been a very happy old couple but for one thing -- they had no little child, and they wished for one very much. One day, when the little old woman was baking … she cut a cake in the shape of a little boy, and put it into the oven.”</strong></p>
<p>Home is the woman who nurtured you. It is her sacrifice and care. Home is her hopes and fears. It is the pain of leaving her there. The old woman made the gingerbread boy to be her special one, but soon he was on run.</p>
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>“Presently she went to the oven to see if it was baked. As soon as the oven door was opened, the little gingerbread boy jumped out, and began to run away as fast as he could go.”</strong></p>
<p>Home stalks. It chases. Home will not go away. Home might haunt you till your last day. The entire village chased the gingerbread boy. No peace could he enjoy.</p> 
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>“But the pig ran, and couldn't catch him. And he ran till he came across a fox, and to him he called out: I've run away from a little old woman, a little old man, a barn full of threshers, a field full of mowers, a cow and a pig, and I can run away from you, I can!”</strong></p>
<p>Home is a threat. It might eat you whole. The wage it demands is your very soul. In the end, the gingerbread boy could not outrun the fox, who ate him without remorse.</p> 
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>“Now foxes can run very fast, and so the fox soon caught the gingerbread boy and began to eat him up. Presently the gingerbread boy said, "Oh dear! I'm quarter gone!" And then, "Oh, I'm half gone!" And soon, "I'm three-quarters gone!" And at last, "I'm all gone!" and never spoke again.”</strong></p>
<p>More than all that, home is a journey that moves ever forward to the bright and the new. Home is to run without fear, without care, without doubt.  Home is not a place, it you, only you. The gingerbread boy still runs to this day. I know it’s so for we run together you might say.</p>
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>“Run! Run! As fast as you can! You can’t catch me, I’m the Gingerbread Man!”</strong></p>
<p>For me, home is a complicated concept. Movement has always been part of my story.  In this regard, the gingerbread boy is a role model, or perhaps an alter ego.  We see the journey as all.  A girl I once knew gave me this toy over thirty years ago. She intended to honor my recent flight from a rotund mall security guard during which I cried, “Run! Run! As fast as you can! You can’t catch me, I’m the gingerbread man!” The little girl’s grandfather had purchased the toy for her in the early 1970s. The gift sealed a relationship, if just for the moment. It then became movement; the journey full speed. Boston, Missouri, LA, Tulsa, Des Moines, and Maine were borrowed homes along the way. At every stop, the gingerbread was there – physically present, and metaphorically influential.</p><a href="#fn16" id="ref16"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/GB_1.jpg"></a>
<p>The Scamp Gingerbread Boy is a plush, stuffed toy manufactured by Douglas Company of Keene, New Hampshire. He measures thirteen inches from heel to crown, with a wingspan close to ten inches. His pose suggests motion – he is running right now. He has a rusty-brown hue, with round, black eyes that match his round, back nose. His only clothes, if you can call them that, consist of two round, white buttons attached to midriff and chest, a red and white scarf, a matching red and white chapeau (the kind you might see in a Parisian café). The toy shows the blemishes of age, including noticeable wear on the left palm. Nevertheless, the boy flashes a constant smile; at least that is what we see. Despite his connection to confection, he does not emit a scent nor does he elicit a tasting experience. His silence invites us to learn his secrets. </p>  
<h3>The Roots of a Spice and Roots of a Story</h3>
<p>Ginger cultivation represents historical trends of globalization and trade. Although initially cultivated in India and China in prehistoric times, the proliferation in the production of ginger came about through its introduction to the Caribbean via New World colonization. Production of the spice grew exponentially in Spanish territories throughout the sixteen and early seventeenth century, until sugar production supplanted the commercial viability of ginger cultivation. The crop did not immediately find a market in Spain. Instead, it took a firmer economic root in northern Europe where ginger offered a wet and hot tropical taste in colder, drier climates.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> The first English uses of ginger appeared within elite cookbooks and recipes of the sixteenth century. Some credit Elizabeth I for ordering the creation of the first gingerbread men. Throughout the seventeenth century, ginger became a common component of English cooking. At the same time, English songwriters lauded ginger for its ability to provide energy and vitality to the unmotivated.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p> 
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>A Poor Soul sate sighing near a Ginger-bread Stall, 
Oh Ginger-bread, oh! Oh Ginger-bread, oh! 
With his Hands in his Pockets, his Head on the Wall; 
Oh Ginger-bread, oh! Oh Ginger-bread, oh!<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></strong></p>

<p>Unlike the story of our Scamp Gingerbread Boy, the gingerbread man narrative is not strictly an American tale, nor solely indicative of a larger American literary genre. The story’s basic tenets are part of the Runaway or Fleeing Pancake folktale genre.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> In the mid-nineteenth century, two Norwegians, Peter Asbjornsen and Jorgen Moe, collected folk traditions from Western Scandinavia as part of a nationalist project to define Norwegian culture. This effort emerged from Norway’s independence from four centuries of Danish rule. Asbjornsen and Moe wanted to use folklore and heritage (including cooking and storytelling) to shape a common understanding of Norwegian culture. The Fleeing Pancake was one folk story that emerged from this endeavor.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> Norway, however, does not hold a monopoly on the fleeing food genre. Other folktales, emanating from Germany, Scotland, Russia and the United States, all intermix tales of a bolting baked good eluding its pursuers before being eaten by a hungry entity. The fleeing pancake is a cumulative tale – offer little plot, relying instead on rhythm and repetition. In the case of the gingerbread chase, the rhymes are used to taunt pursuers while each new encounter builds suspense, leading to the climax: the baked good being consumed by its final chaser.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup><sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> </p>
<h3>Alterations in the Journey</h3>   
<p>The Gingerbread Boy of the American imagination first appeared in print in 1875 in the St. Nicholas Magazine for Boys and Girls. The anonymous author indicated that the story was “not strictly original. He had written it down after a servant girl relayed it to his children.”<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> In a mischievous and less taunting fashion, upon opening the oven door, the gingerbread boy jumped out and ran away.</p> <a href="#fn17" id="ref17"><img style="width:100%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/1875.png"></a>
<p style=“margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;”><strong>“I’ve run a-way from a lit-tle old wom-an, a lit-tle old man, And I can run a-way from you, I can!”<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup></strong></p>
<p>In later versions, the gingerbread boy became an anti-authority legend. He mocked and taunted his pursuers with the now iconic line:</p> 
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>“Run! Run! As fast as you can! You can’t catch me, I’m the Gingerbread Man!<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup></strong></p>
<p>The gingerbread story was further expanded and altered at the turn of the twentieth century. Frank Baum incorporated it into his Oz mythology and Frederic Ranken and Alfred Baldwin Sloane adapted it into a musical. Both enterprises use the name of John Dough for the gingerbread creation but retain little, beyond the materiality of the central figure, of the original gingerbread story. Nonetheless, Ranken’s 1905 opening and Baum’s 1906 publication helped popularize the central fairy tale figure of the gingerbread man. Ranken’s musical centers on the story of flavorful King of BonBonLand who is living in fear of being eaten after being turned into a gingerbread man by his nemesis, Marchevavelius. The intrepid Mr. and Mrs. Clause eventually resolve the conflict by turning the King back into a human being.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> </p>
<a href="#fn18" id="ref18"><embed style="width:100%;height:200px;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/RankenBill.pdf"></a>
<p style="margin-left:5%;font-size:75%;text-align:center;"><strong>My life's a gingersnap, They've hung me in a window, marked
A penny each a throw, And the girls on the street
Say I'm just fit to eat, The original John Dough.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></strong></p>

<p>In Baum’s iteration, John Dough is the accidental creation of a baker trying to create a large gingerbread man to celebrate July Fourth. After mixing in an Arabian Elixir of Life, the dough comes alive and eventually embarks on a journey with Chick the Cherub, a central figure in this gingerbread incarnation.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> Ali Dubh, who had planned to use the elixir to grant himself health and longevity, pursued John Dough. John Dough now embodied these qualities. After eluding Ali Dubh, John Dough became the ruler of Hiland and Loland, a realm of people who were awaiting the coming of a non-human replacement king.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> Each interpretation adds elements to the gingerbread story while retaining the tale’s central components: fear of consumption and aspects of the chase/journey.</p>
<a href="#fn19" id="ref19"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/BaumGB.jpg"></a>
<h3>The Journey Toward Home</h3>
<p>The gingerbread boy narrative, and its many iterations, embodies multiple anxieties – desire, intimacy, confinement, freedom, and consumption.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> These anxieties, all rooted in home, fuel the journey. Like the boy, they made me the adventurous kind. Now, consider your own path, with these last words in your mind.</p> <br>
<h4 style="text-decoration:underline;text-align:center;">Long Live the Gingerbread Boy</h4>
<!--Change the font of the pre element below.-->
<pre style="text-align:center;">A tale embedded in old Viking snow,
A fleeing pancake obscure, but the cookie you know.

The good woman dreamed of one she could hold,
In the oven he went to be caste from a mold.

But the boy’s plans transcended the plain wooded home,
He yearned for adventure, no choice but to roam.

He ran from those who wished him harm,
His ceaseless movement caused the woman alarm.

Wherever the journey, his wry smile stayed clear,
Keep moving, keep moving without worry or fear.

In the end he was eaten, devoured in whole,
Yet pay close attention, sense the gingerbread’s soul.

There is a lesson to learn from the cookie boy’s tale,
Life lived at full speed is never a fail.</pre>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Anxiety, Nostalgia, and Halloween</h2>

            <h3 style="text-align:center;">A Halloween Collection</h3>
                <p>This candy container tells the story of home: The home where a young child sat, exhausted after a long night of trick-or-treating, as they devoured the sweet, colorful candy that once filled this container. An ancient, Celtic home filled with the rich scent of pine and heavy with anticipation of Samhain festivals. A new home in an unfamiliar place that Irish refugees built with the traditions, games, and beliefs they held dear. The home where anxious parents waited as their children embarked on neighborhood adventures. And the home of the collector, where the candy container sits, a prized possession.<a href="#fn9" id="ref9"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding:0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto3.jpg"></a></p>

                <p>My grandfather, a collector of many things, gifted this candy container to me when I was a teenager. The candy container, made in the 1950s, has been with me ever since, along with my growing collection of Halloween items. While I’ve moved several times, the candy container is always there, it is a necessary part of my home.</p>

                <p>A sweet, musty odor emanates from the small candy container - residue from candy held long ago and the smell of aged, stored plastic. Holding the container requires cautious hands, as one can almost feel the brittle plastic giving way. When I set it on the table it clinks of cheap, thin plastic. The container is showing its age, as there are some scratches, scuff marks, and fading of the paint, signs of moving and unprotected display. On the lower back side of the container, you can feel etched plastic that reads: “ROSBRO PLASTICS PROV. R.I.”<a href="#fn10" id="ref10"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto4.jpeg"></a></p>

        <h3>Folklore and Tradition</h3>
                <p>The Jack-o-lantern, looking amused on the back of the <a href="http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198607663.001.0001/acref-9780198607663-e-150" target="_blank">cat</a>, is the spirit of a man, too evil to enter Heaven and rejected by the Devil. Doomed to walk the earth forever, Jack placed a hot coal in a gourd and now wanders alone, banished from Heaven and Hell. In Celtic tradition, organic objects - fruits and vegetables - represented both the harvest and concepts of the spirit world. Gourds, like the one Jack used, were central to the ancient Celtic celebration of Samhain, a New Year celebration and marker of the harvest. Stories of Samhain traditions reveal that during Samhain, supernatural entrances to other worlds opened. As the supernatural and human realms collided men battled demons and made love to supernatural women. Samhain was unpredictable, dangerous and exciting, revealing the anxieties of peoples whose home lands were threatened by Christian expansion.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

        <a href="#fn11" id="ref11"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto6.jpg"></a>

             <p>As Christians appropriated these Celtic traditions and established All Souls Day in the Middle Ages, Samhain-like festivals spread throughout Europe, and eventually to the United States. However, modern Halloween celebrations only began to take shape in the United States in the late 19th century when Irish refugees fled to the United States in large numbers. Met with racism, these refugees created new homes and communities out of ancient traditions.</p>

            <h3>Halloween in America</h3>
                <p>While the candy container reminds us of sweet candy corn and chocolate, twentieth-century Halloween celebrations were more trick than treat. Children overturned outhouses and threw rotten vegetables at homes and residents alike. Young “gangsters” threatened elderly neighbors on their doorsteps with “trick-or-treat.”<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> But as “trick-or-treating” grew in popularity, a night of mischief became tame. By 1940, both Irish Americans and Halloween solidified their place in an emerging, white middle class.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Throughout the United States, upper class women hosted Halloween parties featuring dinner, dancing, and a wide range of games.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p>

        <a href="#fn12" id="ref12"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto5.jpg"></a>

               <p>The engraving on the bottom of the candy container, “ROSBRO PLASTICS PROV. R.I.” reveals the beginning of a now nearly ubiquitous relationship between Halloween and candy, marked by mass production and consumption. In the early twentieth-century, folks appeased trick-or-treaters with homemade caramelized popcorn balls and sweet candied apples. However, as cities grew and suburbs expanded, so too did the number of trick-or-treaters. In the 1950s, small plastic and packaged candy containers like this became a more convenient and less expensive option to dish out to the hoards of young tricksters at their door.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></p>

                <p>However, this candy container isn’t only the product of affordability and convenience. Consumed with fear of the “Halloween sadist” with his poisoned candy and razor blade apples, worried parents turned to prepackaged treats throughout the 1960s and 1980s. Newspapers warned of the terrors of trick-or-treating, and some communities went so far to ban trick-or-treating. The Jack-O-Lantern smiles at us, because he knows that these myths and rumors were the greatest Halloween trick of all.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto2.png"></a> A sign of the anxiety of a nation in crisis, these stories make good sense. On the nightly news, stories of poisoned popcorn balls and bubble gum played out alongside images of violent civil rights demonstrations, riots, and the Vietnam war.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Parents became cautious and skeptical of a cherished tradition. They hurried their children home to safety, eager to inspect their children’s loot.</p>

            <a href="#fn14" id="ref14"><img style="clear:left;width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto1.png"></a><br>

        <h3>A Halloween Collection, Revisited</h3>
                <p>Nostalgic for the days of carefree trick-or-treating, people began to collect vintage Halloween memorabilia in the 1980s. My grandmother started collecting Halloween items after finding a glass Halloween candy container in an antique shop that was in her home as a child. Together, my grandparents became avid collectors. Comparing trick-or-treating today to the 1940s, Derek’s grandfather remarked that it was “not that much different, but no one thought about the danger of Halloween.”<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></p>
<a href="#fn15" id="ref15"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/CandyPhoto7.jpg"></a>

                <p>Collecting allows us to peel back the layers of Halloween. There exists a dark history behind this smiling jack-o-lantern. Fear is a central part of Halloween. Children march from house to house begging at neighbors’ doors, while parents wait anxiously for their return home. Yet Halloween is sweet and exciting. The candy container speaks of happy memories of trick-or-treating, of family. What does collecting truly represent? Could it be nostalgia, or, instead, an outlet for our deepest fears?</p>

          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Histories and Home</h1><h2 style="text-align:center;">In a Leather Notebook</h2>

            <h3>What is “home”?</h3>
                <p>What is “home?” “Home” is embedded in this notebook.“Home” is the taste of fresh caught crabs and Old Bay. Home is the sounds and smells of the Celtic Festival, the Jousting Tournament, the Renaissance Festival.<a href="#fn10" id="ref10"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/ren-faire.jpg"></a></p>

                <p>I bought this miniature embossed leather notebook at the Maryland Renaissance Festival around 2010. It settles nicely in my hand. It feels natural. Earthy. The rigid, embossed front unfolds to reveal unfinished leather and rough, unlined paper. At the time, I thought I might have something to add behind the facade one day. The notebook was in my possession for about a year before I left home during my senior year of high school because a parent tried to prevent me from continuing my education. This was the only item I took from the house. Sometimes I wonder, why <i>this</i> thing?</p>

            <h3>The "Renaissance"</h3>
                <p>Most surviving miniature books of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (now called the "Early Modern" period in most academic circles) were individualized Catholic prayer books popular in the 13th and 14th centuries.<a href="#fn11" id="ref11"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/jeanne-hours.jpg"></a> This was the time of the Black Death, the Hundred Years War and the Avignon papacy. The prayer books were signs of the privatization of faith, of the increasing reliance on personal devotion as old institutions were torn asunder. The aspects of “home” which had once seemed so stable: the Church, social order, personal well-being, were all unsettled. These books were born of fear and anxiety in a world steeped in blood, plague, death.</p> 

                <p>This, though, is a modern souvenir which “displaces the point of authenticity as it itself becomes the point of origin for narrative.”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Modern miniature books sold at Renaissance festivals are not exclusively created or sold for religious purposes as these modern festivals developed during the 1960s.<a href="#fn12" id="ref12"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/islamic1.png"></a> They are not “authentic” replicas of Books of Hours. This notebook, for example, contains Islamic influences seen in the folded cover and the natural and geometric patterns on the leather.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> The inclusion of this stylistic element was not common in Renaissance miniature prayer books, but is more so in Renaissance festival crafts.</p> 

                <p>The Islamic influences in the design speak to a history of exploitation during the Reconquista and the Crusades.<a href="#fn13" id="ref13"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/islamic2.png"></a> As Crusaders returned from Jerusalem and Spain, they brought back new artistic inspirations. But they also carried home a religiously fueled hysteria which resulted in the unsettling and massacring of Jews, Muslims, and perceived heretics throughout Europe. The gentle floral field on the leather notebook’s cover hides the massacre of the Jews of Worms in 1096, the frenzied butchering of the Muslims and Jews of Jerusalem in 1099, the blood of Cathars flowing through the hyacinth and poppies of Béziers in the summer of 1209, flowing like the stinking blood of cattle at the slaughter…</p>

                <p>Made of the skin of a cow, this notebook speaks to us through smell as well as sight. Leather, real leather, has a distinctive smell, an ancient smell. In medieval Europe, the tanning process was a dirty job. First, the cattle had to be killed, usually by a butcher. A tanner then scraped the hides clean of their blood, soaked them in urine, re-scraped the hides, soaked them again in bird droppings or stale beer, left them in a solution of oak bark and water for over a year, and then a currier worked the now tanned hides into usable leather.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Modern artisans no longer produce leather this way, instead tended to buy industrially produced, chemically treated leather.<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding:0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/IMG_3029.JPG"></p> 

                <p>Even so, Renaissance festival craftsmanship prides itself on authenticity. Artisans’ “labor was the labor of the hand, of the body, and the product, in its uniqueness, was a stay against Repetition and inauthenticity.”<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> The emphasis on personal craftsmanship and the Renaissance continues to resonate with modern Americans. The image of the individual artisan living on his own labor flows easily into the American archetype of the lone cowboy, living on the “open range.” As historian Paul Grendler argues, “Americans really love the American West… like the Renaissance, it is viewed as an age of individual achievement.”<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></p>

            <h3>The "Old West"</h3>
                <p>In the popular conception of the “American West,” leather was used less for books and more for saddles and gun holsters.<a href="#fn14" id="ref14"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/guns.gif"></a> When we think of the “Old West” we can almost hear the thundering hooves of cattle, the creaking leather of a saddle, the screeching of an incoming train.</p>

                <p>But whose home was “the West”? In the 1840s, Brigham Young said, “We will raise our wheat… and produce everything that will make our bodies comfortable and happy and in this manner we intend to build up Zion on the earth.”<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> Mormon settlers hoped to make the West “home.” But there was an addendum to Young’s speech. He added “...and purify it and cleanse it from all pollutions.”<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> In the Mormon settling of "the West," who was unsettled? The history of the Mormon move westward is a story of displacement, often violent, of native people. Their cattle grazed on lands relied upon by native people. They massacred new settlers and blamed Native Americans for the slaughter.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> Creating home is a dirty job.</p>

                <p>The sounds of Westward expansion were the of a groaning wagon wheel, a rail spike being driven into the ground. These were the sounds of home being taken, and home being built. But when I think of “the West,” I don’t hear hear the melodies of Mormon music. Maybe I should. Today, as the sound of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir drifts through households across the United States, we are reminded that Mormons still seek to establish America as home. Historian Benjamin Lindquist argues that the Mormon Tabernacle Choir functions to convince Americans that “not only possessed quintessentially American characteristics, but they had colonized the Great Basin and, consequently, earned the right to remain there.”<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> Sound stakes a claim to “home”.<a href="#fn15" id="ref15"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/cowboys.jpg"></a></p> 

                <p>These stories of “the West” don’t make it into the popular imagination. They don’t have all the fictive romance of a cattle drive or the rugged cowboy. But in the popular imagination, it is bold individualism that speak to us from both the Renaissance and the Old West. It speaks to us through creaking leather. So, why did I take <em>this</em> thing? The notebook embodies histories: of individualism, of self-definition, but also of dispossession and control.</p>

            <h3>What is “home," Part 2</h3>
                <p>Can "home" unsettle? When "you can't go home again," what is home? “Home” is leaving one Spring afternoon, feeling the sun on your face, the weight lift off your shoulders, and of not looking back. “Home” is a small, still empty, leather notebook sitting in a dark closet for 6 years. And “home” is forcing yourself to look back by keeping an uncomfortable reminder of your past on your bedside table. It is realizing that a notebook is more than a tangible thing. It embodies your past, and your drive towards the future. “Home” is looking at a leather notebook and still smelling the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">What is home?</h3> 
<p>Is there such a thing as home? We have different understandings and feelings about home, shaped by our past, but for Judy Kertesz home materializes in her grandmother’s cooking journal. For Judy Kertesz home is the memory about her grandmother’s arrival before the holidays and Margit Muresian Kert&eacute;sz Halmos’ daily routine of reading in bed early in the morning. Home is the memory of the dishes she once cooked with her grandmother in anticipation of the family and friends coming together to eat.<a href="#fn7" id="ref7"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/peppers.jpg"></a> Home is the recollection how she was once only six years old, barely tall enough to look over the kitchen counter, seeing her grandmother’s cooking journal for the first time, which she could not read yet, laying open. The memory of herself patiently waiting for Margit to tell her the next step of the recipe while she read her notes and explaining where she had gathered some of the recipes. The sound of the grinder reminds her of the liver she once grinded for the long-lost grandmother while her sister took no interest in the preparations. Home is the memory of how her grandmother mixed the different ingredients for the cake while little Judy waited anxiously by her side to get a chance to lick the spoon with the sweet cake batter. The journal bridges a gap from the past to present through recipes. They hold within them so much of everyday life, thought and activity across time, place and generation.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

<h3>An object of history:</h3>									

<p>Margit’s journal that was once mass produced as cheap writing material for children with its now yellowed, brittle pages is the testimony of a rich cooking heritage located in German, Hungarian, and Ashkenazi recipes. Thin and fragile pages in the Hungarian school journal, which were not meant to endure, now feel dry when turned, promise a re-discovery of a long-forgotten dish, evoking memories of childhood. The carefully taped grainy cover and its smooth edges speaks to the anxiety to lose what is left of the family’s heritage. A variety of additional inlay pages with typed or handwritten notes remind us of the need to adapt to the new home after the diaspora. Short paragraphs in Hungarian with incomplete recipes warn us of the transience of knowledge. Broken off, folded and dried out corners commemorate the lost family members who once enjoyed those meals. The early 20th century German Suetterlin handwriting in blue ink or pencil, which starts to fade away, stresses the fast pace of change and tell a story of ingredients no longer available. The smell of deteriorating paper with hints of vanilla, a tang of acid over an underlying mustiness admonishes us of the inevitability of time passing. Many families had a designated notebook in which to record, create, and communicate these necessary bits of practical knowledge.</p>

<h3>Establishing a life in the Austro-Hungarian Empire</h3>

<p>Margit’s cookbook, however, is about so much more than just a family’s collected recipes. It tells the story of the 19th and 20th century. It tells stories about significant political events, it tells the formation of new identities, imminent dangers, the struggle for survival as well as the determination to survive as a family and as a people. The journal embodies the new community in the diaspora coming together to relive a save portion of the past. It serves as a material object that materializes deep memory of the family heritages, making Margit Muresian Kert&eacute;sz Halmos’s cooking journal a story of home and belonging, no matter what life brings along.<a href="#fn8" id="ref8"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/1890.jpg"></a></p>
          
<p>Born in 1903 into an Orthodox - Catholic family in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Margit lived to see great changes. The end of the Great Compromise of 1867, that created the Austro - Hungarian Empire, began with the assassination of Francis Joseph in 1916 and culminated in the final surrender of his successor Charles I and his allies in 1918 which would also end World War I. Margit spent the uncertain years of World War I as a refuge like many other displaced people, wandering from Temeswar, Hungary, to Breslau in modern Poland. The teenager Margit experienced the food shortages on a daily base. Survival was a daily struggle for her and the many others that escaped. Was she dreaming about her childhood home in those years, remembering the delicious aromas when her mother prepared a meal?</p>	<a href="#fn4" id="ref4"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/candle.png"></a>
<p>After the war had ended, it took her yet another year to go back to Budapest, Hungary, where she and her family would rebuild their life. Ten years into the interwar period, Margit Muresian became Margit Kert&eacute;sz. The woman with the Romanian - German ancestry, whose sheer existence was an expression of the complexities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, added yet another layer to her identity when she converted to the Jewish faith. However, she always remained a devout catholic woman, which was motivated by her later hate against protestants and their support for the rising Nazi government. Unlike in other eastern-European countries, the young Empire did not follow a policy of separation with their Jewish population enabling Margit to surround herself with many Jewish friends in Budapest during her youth.</p>
          
<p>The same year 1867, which was so important for Margit’s complex history, was also a central date for her husband’s ancestry as it granted the formerly severely restricted Jewish full population emancipation, which allowed them to play a vital role in society and consequently allowed Margit to marry Miklos Kert&eacute;sz.<a href="#fn9" id="ref9"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/budapestBridge.jpg"></a> However, increasing anti-Semitic laws during the 1920s and 1930s made being Jewish more difficult. Why did Margit decide during those difficult years officially to convert when she continued to practice Catholicism? Some days as many as 5000 Jews turned their backs on their religion to escape prosecution. The first law in 1928 that reduced Jews in institutions of education to five percent of the student population might not have affected the newlyweds. They instead completed their family with a son Istvan in 1929 and daughter Vera in 1933, which the father wouldn’t see to grow up, as he prematurely passed in 1937. Was it at that time that Margit realized the fleeting of life and with it, the memory of what was?</p>
<p>Memory is central to Judaism. The modern word for history in Hebrew derives from the Greek &#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#953;&#945;, far more important for Judaism, however, is &#1503;&#1493;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1494; (<em>Zikaron</em>) or memory. <em>Zikaron</em> is a common Hebrew word in liturgy as well as literature. The word first appears when God remembers Noah and the other living creatures in the ark and when God remembers his covenant after the great flood.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/bridge.png"></a> Rosh Hashanah is referred to as the Day of Remembrance in the <em>Zikhronot</em>, translating to remembrances, is comprised of biblical verses dealing with God’s remembering.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> While history is made of objective facts, memory is individual; it is a part of us. It is meant to be subjective. This is essential to Jewish life, what has been is not just recounted; it is relived in the many rituals that determine the religious calendar. How could you better relive the memory of what was then through the delicious recipes of your childhood? How better to remember than through the smells that come from the kitchen?</p>

<h3>Hiding and Diaspora</h3> 

	<p>Life was to become even more challenging with the laws of 1939, reducing the Jewish participation in liberal professions, administration, and commerce to twenty percent, and the Nazi rising. As many fled for work into Budapest, Margit lived with her two children in an apartment in Budapest as a single mother. It was a family tradition to send the children out to the countryside during the summer to spend time with the extended family. Margit wanted her children to experience the carefree days she had missed during World War I when she was a teenager herself. It was in the fateful May of 1944 that her two children spent their summer in Szechen. The Nazis started to round up Jews in rural areas to deport them to Auschwitz, and Margit suddenly learned that her cousins had given her children to Christian neighbors before her family was deported themselves. Did she again feel the anxiety of the fleeting of life when her children barely escaped with their life and had to be smuggled back into the city? Did Margit realize that they would be the last ones of their family who could pass on the family heritage?</p> 
          <p>In the complexities of the city of Budapest, Jews were able to go into hiding and so did Margit. Spending eleven months in a basement, did she think about the recipes she would one day write down in her cooking journal? Was she contemplating to write down her family’s food legacy as she provided scarce meals consisting of not much more than beans for her family and the neighbor families who had mocked her before for storing dried beans? Did she remember the food scarcity of her teenage years while she was waiting for yet another air raid? Did she relive the memory of hunger while cooking meager meals? Was she thinking about the different foods she had seen while wandering through Europe, waiting that yet another period of change in the history of Hungary went by?</p><a href="#fn6" id="ref6"><img style="width:40%;float:right;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/basement.png"></a>		
<p>With Hungary being liberated from the Nazi’s and Margit, Istvan, and Vera able to come out of their hiding, did they realize that their home had changed. Many of the people from their community, had been murdered, but enough people had survived that 250 communities could be reestablished across Hungary. And again, just as in 1867, another year was to change Margit’s life and the life of the Jewish community forever.</p> 
          <p>As the Jewish communities were officially recognized and got granted freedom of religious practice in 1948 again, Margit got married to her second Jewish husband, Sandor Halmos. Was it this sudden stage of peace that made her decide to start writing down her legacy of cooking? Was it the constant reminder of the absence of her extended family that led her to immortalize what she had learned from them? Maybe she felt that, as her children were seeking new opportunities in foreign countries, it was important to write down the memory of what was, to build a bridge to future generations. The cooking journal, Margit would write, became the antithesis to the fascist ideology; the cooking journal would prove the complexities of European history with shifting borders and sudden political changes, shifting identities, and the multitude of heritage a single person could unite in herself. The little brittle journal the refugee Margit would be able to take with her on her way out of Hungary, while leaving behind her larger property and old life, would make the long way into a new life and to her descendants.</p> 

<h3>Home is what is left behind.</h3>

<p>We asked before what is home?<a href="#fn5" id="ref5"><img style="width:40%;float:left;padding: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/bronx.jpg"></a> Is home just the romanticized memory of a child? Home is so much more. Home is the realization that your family which once had many members now only consists of the few people who managed to hide. Home is reliving the trauma of forced migration in a new community that shares the same sensibilities and which comes together at holidays to enjoy food they once ate in their old homes. Home are the discussions during these meals about the diaspora, which forced them to leave behind more than just furniture and paintings but what they once considered home. It is the conversations of the small Hungarian – Jewish community in the Bronx, the child Judy Kertesz listened to quietly while adults talked about the challenges of adaptations to the old meals in the new country. Home is the realization that conversations about cooking drowned the silence of the trauma and gave them back a sense of control they lost when six million others were murdered.</p>
