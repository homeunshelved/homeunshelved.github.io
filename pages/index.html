          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Histories and Home</h1><h2 style="text-align:center;">In a Leather Notebook</h2>

            <h3>What is “home”?</h3>
                <p>What is “home?” “Home” is embedded in this notebook.“Home” is the taste of fresh caught crabs and Old Bay. Home is the sounds and smells of the Celtic Festival, the Jousting Tournament, the Renaissance Festival.<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding:0 10px 0 0;" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/ren-faire.jpg" target="_blank"></p>

                <p>I bought this miniature embossed leather notebook at the Maryland Renaissance Festival around 2010. It settles nicely in my hand. It feels natural. Earthy. The rigid, embossed front unfolds to reveal unfinished leather and rough, unlined paper. At the time, I thought I might have something to add behind the facade one day. The notebook was in my possession for about a year before I left home during my senior year of high school because a parent tried to prevent me from continuing my education. This was the only item I took from the house. Sometimes I wonder, why <i>this</i> thing?</p>

            <h3>The "Renaissance"</h3>
                <p>Most surviving miniature books of the Medieval and the Early Modern periods were individualized Catholic prayer books popular in the 13th and 14th centuries.<img style="width:40%;float:right;padding:0 10px 0 0;" target="_blank" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/jeanne-hours.jpg"> This was the time of the Black Death, the Hundred Years War and the Avignon papacy. The prayer books were signs of the privatization of faith, of the increasing reliance on personal devotion as old institutions were torn asunder. The aspects of “home” which had once seemed so stable: the Church, social order, personal well-being, were all unsettled. These books were born of fear and anxiety in a world steeped in blood, plague, death.</p> 

                <p>This, though, is a modern souvenir which “displaces the point of authenticity as it itself becomes the point of origin for narrative.”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Modern miniature books sold at Renaissance festivals are not exclusively created or sold for religious purposes as these modern festivals developed during the 1960s.<img style="width:40%;float:right;padding:0 10px 0 0;" target="_blank" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/islamic1.png"> They are not “authentic” replicas of Books of Hours. This notebook, for example, contains Islamic influences seen in the folded cover and the natural and geometric patterns on the leather.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> The inclusion of this stylistic element was not common in Renaissance miniature prayer books, but is more so in Renaissance festival crafts.</p> 

                <p>The Islamic influences in the design speak to a history of exploitation during the Reconquista and the Crusades.<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding:0 10px 0 0;" target="_blank" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/islamic2.png"> As Crusaders returned from Jerusalem and Spain, they brought back new artistic inspirations. But they also carried home a religiously fueled hysteria which resulted in the unsettling and massacring of Jews, Muslims, and perceived heretics throughout Europe. The gentle floral field on the leather notebook’s cover hides the massacre of the Jews of Worms in 1096, the frenzied butchering of the Muslims and Jews of Jerusalem in 1099, the blood of Cathars flowing through the hyacinth and poppies of Béziers in the summer of 1209, flowing like the stinking blood of cattle at the slaughter…</p>

                <p>Made of the skin of a cow, this notebook speaks to us through smell as well as sight. Leather, real leather, has a distinctive smell, an ancient smell. In medieval Europe, the tanning process was a dirty job. First, the cattle had to be killed, usually by a butcher. A tanner then scraped the hides clean of their blood, soaked them in urine, re-scraped the hides, soaked them again in bird droppings or stale beer, left them in a solution of oak bark and water for over a year, and then a currier worked the now tanned hides into usable leather.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Modern artisans no longer produce leather this way, instead tended to buy industrially produced, chemically treated leather.<img style="width:40%;float:right;padding:0 10px 0 0;" target="_blank" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/IMG_3029.JPG"></p> 

                <p>Even so, Renaissance festival craftsmanship prides itself on authenticity. Artisans’ “labor was the labor of the hand, of the body, and the product, in its uniqueness, was a stay against Repetition and inauthenticity.”<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> The emphasis on personal craftsmanship and the Renaissance continues to resonate with modern Americans. The image of the individual artisan living on his own labor flows easily into the American archetype of the lone cowboy, living on the “open range.” As historian Paul Grendler argues, “Americans really love the American West… like the Renaissance, it is viewed as an age of individual achievement.”<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></p>

            <h3>The "Old West"</h3>
                <p>In the popular conception of the “American West”, leather was used less for books and more for saddles and gun holsters.<img style="width:40%;float:right;padding:0 10px 0 0;" target="_blank" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/guns.gif"> When we think of the “Old West” we can almost hear the thundering hooves of cattle, the creaking leather of a saddle, the screeching of an incoming train.</p>

                <p>But whose home was “the West”? In the 1840s, Brigham Young said, “We will raise our wheat… and produce everything that will make our bodies comfortable and happy and in this manner we intend to build up Zion on the earth.”<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> Mormon settlers hoped to make the West “home.” But there was an addendum to Young’s speech. He added “...and purify it and cleanse it from all pollutions.”<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> In the Mormon settling of the West, who was unsettled? The history of the Mormon colonization of the west is a story of displacement, often violent, of native people. Their cattle grazed on lands relied upon by native people. They massacred new settlers and blamed Native Americans for the slaughter.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> Creating home is a dirty job.</p>

                <p>The sounds of Westward expansion were the of a groaning wagon wheel, a rail spike being driven into the ground. These were the sounds of home being taken, and home being built. But when I think of “the West,” I don’t hear hear the melodies of Mormon music. Maybe I should. Today, as the sound of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir drifts through households across the United States, we are reminded that Mormons still seek to establish America as home. Historian Benjamin Lindquist argues that the Mormon Tabernacle Choir functions to convince Americans that “not only possessed quintessentially American characteristics, but they had colonized the Great Basin and, consequently, earned the right to remain there.”<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> Sound stakes a claim to “home”.<img style="width:40%;float:left;padding:0 10px 0 0;" target="_blank" src="https://homeunshelved.github.io/pages/photos/cowboys.jpg"></p> 

                <p>These stories of “the West” don’t make it into the popular imagination. They don’t have all the fictive romance of a cattle drive or the rugged cowboy. But in the popular imagination, it is bold individualism that speak to us from both the Renaissance and the Old West. It speaks to us through creaking leather. So, why did I take <em>this</em> thing? The notebook embodies histories: of individualism, of self-definition, but also of dispossession and control.</p>

            <h3>What is “home”, part 2</h3>
                <p>So, now, what is home? “Home” is unsettled. “Home” is leaving one Spring afternoon, feeling the sun on your face, the weight lift off your shoulders, and of not looking back. “Home” is a small, still empty, leather notebook sitting in a dark closet for 6 years. And “home” is keeping an uncomfortable reminder of your past on your bedside table, forcing yourself to look back. And realizing that a notebook is more than a tangible thing. It embodies your past, and your drive towards the future. “Home” is looking at a leather notebook and smelling the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
